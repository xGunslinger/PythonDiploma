Dataset: csv table that contains matrix of size nxm, where N is the number of atoms and M is 15 (the total number of orbits). Thus, each element of the matrix contains the degree of a particular orbit for each node (atom).
The first column is response variable (Y), from column 2 to 16 is feature vector (or X). We use X (orbits from O0 to O14) to predict Y (temperature B factor).
